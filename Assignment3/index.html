        <td><h3>Judgments of Purpose</h3>My desired outcome for the project</td>
        <td>The aim of the Bread Maker project was to create an engaging, interactive web experience that simulates a number of bread-making steps in stylized, interactive form. I wanted users to move through a mini adventure—arriving at the home page, adding ingredients, interacting with dough, and finally drawing on the toasted bread. The goal was to create something with the feel of a playful digital cooking toy, combining touch interactions, storytelling, and imagination.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><h3>Judgments of Worth</h3>What values, besides novelty, were important for the project?</td>
        <td>Apart from novelty, I valued user engagement, creativity, and accessibility. I aimed to make each page approachable for a general audience without prior instructions, encouraging exploration through intuitive design. I also wanted to provide space for self-expression, especially on the drawing page where users can decorate the oven. These values helped guide the interaction and visual design throughout.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><h3>Judgments of Framing</h3>What were the limitations (conceptual and/or technical) you placed on the project's design space?</td>
        <td>Conceptually, I had thought of the project as a series of connected, small activities in terms of bread making. But one fundamental constraint was that these elements were not properly integrated. Each page—home, add ingredients, dough interaction, drawing—is isolated from the others, but they don't influence each other significantly. The ingredients selected on the add-ingredients page, for example, don't affect the dough behavior or the end outcome of the bread, which harms interactivity and cohesion.<br><br>
        Technically, I chose lightweight tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some matter.js to keep the project browser-friendly and manageable. With six pages to build (some with overlapping function), I had to carefully plan and divide my time. Pages like the ingredient selection and dough interaction were especially challenging, as I had no prior experience with interactive visuals or morphing shapes. These required extensive research, trial and error, and pushed my technical skills. While the limitations helped focus the project, they also restricted deeper interaction and stronger page-to-page connections.

      <tr>
        <td><h3>Judgments of Appearance</h3>What were your choices and intentions in relation to the style/character/aesthetics of the project?</td>
        <td>My visual intentions included a soft, playful aesthetic using purple as a primary color and introducing characters like a dog and a chef to enhance storytelling. I wanted to create a friendly and whimsical atmosphere. However, some final implementations did not match my original visual proposal—for example, I planned for a round bowl in the ingredient page, but couldn't achieve the correct shape with CSS, which weakened the visual clarity of that step</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Judgments of Quality</h3>What choices did you make about the technical implementation of the project?</td>
        <td>Technically, I chose clean, responsive, and functional code. Simple web technologies were employed to provide broad compatibility and simplicity. All input was designed to return immediate visual feedback, such as changing colors, animations, or sound effects. Each page's code was modular and self-contained, which helped stability but at the expense of no continuous state or data carried over from page to page. While technically refined on a page-by-page level, this selection limited the overall consistency of the project.

      <tr>
        <td><h3>Judgments of Composition</h3>How did you balance the project as a gestalt whole?</td>
        <td>
          My goal was to create a cohesive, step-by-step experience where each stage of the bread-making process flowed naturally into the next. While each page featured a distinct interactive element—like selecting ingredients or shaping dough—the lack of data continuity between stages meant they functioned more like standalone mini-games than parts of a unified system. 
          <br><br>
          I used consistent characters and visual styles to try to tie everything together, but without shared logic or consequences across pages, user actions didn’t influence future steps or the final outcome, which weakened the sense of overall coherence.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Judgments of Navigation</h3>What did you choose to prioritise during your project's development?
</td>
        <td>I initially aimed for linear storytelling, with "next step" buttons guiding users from one stage to the next. But in execution, the experience felt more non-linear and exploratory. While users can click through the steps in order, the lack of memory between pages means that interactions do not build on each other. There’s no sense of progress or consequence, which undercut my intended narrative structure. I now recognize that creating a more connected flow—with logic or state passed across pages—would improve storytelling and engagement.</td>
